Alaysha Jefferson loves cheerleading at the Hallsville High School in Hallsville, Missouri. Living in a small town that has the population of 1,300 and without a car to drive around, Alaysha has a quiet life. She spends her time in classes, cheerleading practice, and doing homework at home. Although she loves Hallsville, growing up as a racial minority is not always easy in this town that is 96% White and 1.5 % African American. Alaysha is learning how to deal with racial issues at the age of 15.
