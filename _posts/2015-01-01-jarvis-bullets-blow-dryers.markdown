Sam Jarvis has spent her entire life living on her family’s rural farm in the small town of Pevely, Missouri. She enjoys the peacefulness of her home, but yearns for an urban lifestyle. As a model student and athlete, she has felt pressure from those close to her to attend college. Instead she plans to follow her long-time passion for cosmetology—an interest she shares with her mother.
