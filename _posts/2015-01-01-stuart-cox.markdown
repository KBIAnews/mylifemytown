Four years ago, Stuart Cox was a three-sport athlete at Centralia High School. All year, he had a ball in his hand and sports on his mind. He still plays pick up basketball at the high school and roams the outfield in softball tournaments, but sports aren't his main focus anymore. That would be his wife, Jamileh, and the life and family they hope to build together in Centralia.
