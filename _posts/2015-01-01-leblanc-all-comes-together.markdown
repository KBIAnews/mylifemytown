In 2012, My Life My Town told Shirley LeBlanc's story. She was a teen mom who gave birth to her first child, Grayson, when she was a senior in high school. Struggling with the challenges that come with being a teenaged mother, LeBlanc-McDonald found support in her mother and her faith. Three years later, Shirley LeBlanc-McDonald is a married mother of three. Her husband, Luke McDonald, already had a daughter, Morgan, from a previous marriage, and in July 2015, LeBlanc-McDonald gave birth to their son, Jackson.
