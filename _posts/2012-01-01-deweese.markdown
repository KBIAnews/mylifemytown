Terry and Tony DeWeese are identical twins and have spent their entire lives together. Upon graduation, Tony and Terry will be apart for the first time in their lives. Terry will enlist in the US Marine Corps and attend basic training at Camp Pendleton in June, and Tony will attend college in Kansas. Tony has Cerebral Palsy, preventing him from enlisting with his brother. The two are “spending as much time together as possible” until June.
