It was winter break of her senior year in High School when Shirley LeBlanc, then 18, found out she was pregnant. A senior at Harrisburg High, she was shocked by the news. Her family, particularly her mother was there to comfort her. "The first thing she helped me realize is that my life isn't over, my life has just changed," LeBlanc said. Her son Grayson was born in July 2011. LeBlanc, now 19, struggles with the loneliness and challenges of single teenage parenthood. However, her faith is the thing that keeps her together.
