Stuart Cox is a 17 year old junior at Centralia High School.

He keeps track of seasons not by name, but by sport. He loves football, basketball and baseball and hopes to continue playing sports in college.

While that’s a focus for his immediate future, he does have plans to raise a family of his own one day. He says he might want to move to a larger town later in life, maybe nearby Mexico or Columbia. But he’s not sure about cities like St. Louis or Kansas City.
