“I like to be good at everything,” says 15-year-old Maria Weimer. The high school freshman from Salisbury, Missouri is only one in a class of 40, which means she can do things like play on the basketball and track teams and sing in the choir, all while maintaining a high GPA. And she tries her best to excel.

Despite her full schedule, for Maria, religion comes first. She comes from a family of seven, including two younger siblings who are adopted from Guatemala.
