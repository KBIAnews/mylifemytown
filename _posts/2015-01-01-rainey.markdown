Trinity Rainey, 20, has grown up a little faster than most. Trinity has graduated from high school, joined the National Guard and fallen in love with her now-wife Sierra. The couple moved from Macon to Columbia, and bought a house with a backyard big enough for their menagerie of dogs. Trinity does farm work once a week with her grandfather, who has grown to be her best friend. The rest of the time she runs errands, relaxes at home and works as a line cook at the hospital. She plans to study Hospitality Management when she returns to MU in the spring.
