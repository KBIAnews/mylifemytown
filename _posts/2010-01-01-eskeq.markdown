Though Caleb Eskew's camouflage attire is nothing unusual for a mid-Missouri teen, it's the reason behind the camo that is intriguing. Caleb is a member of the Missouri Militia, where he spends his time making camp, practicing his shooting and creating traps out of trip wire.

But most of all, Caleb values the relationships he builds with the older men in the militia. He appreciates surrounding himself with like-minded people and creating a network of people he trusts.
